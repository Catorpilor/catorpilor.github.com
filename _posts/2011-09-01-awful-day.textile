today was a busy day that's what i thought at first cause i was always busy coding and couldn't take time to deal with my house rent thing. But when i look back i found that i just did the repeat 'shit thing'.

In the morning i fixed the file transfer function and tested it worked well.But i didn't figure out why it didn't work well before cause i add two 'assurance thing'  first i changed the file attribute  to 0  then i modified the destination path and jobs done.

Later in the afternoon i was about to implement a sound play feature.It was designed to include three functions play pause and stop.I just checked the win32 api PlaySound with which i implemented the play and stop thing i couldn't find the way to pause the sound. But now wait a second i just googled it again and find something that maybe helpful for this problem but i can't test now cause there is no IDE on this computer so  i will check it tomorrow.

That's all good night!
